Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aslanahmedov/market-basket-analysis

This repository contains code for analyzing market basket data and gaining insights into customer purchase behavior. In order to run the code successfully, please follow the instructions below.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebooks)

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/Syedkalam1/AI-project-.git


# Navigate to the project directory:

cd market-basket-insights


# Install the required Python packages using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt


# Data Preparation

Before running the code, make sure you have the market basket data in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, Excel). Place the data file in the `data/` directory within the project folder.

## Usage

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Run the Jupyter Notebook `Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb` to explore the dataset and gain initial insights into customer behavior.

   jupyter notebook Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb

2. **Market Basket Analysis**: Execute the script `market_basket_analysis.py` to perform association rule mining and identify patterns in customer purchases.

   python market_basket_analysis.py
  
   This will generate a report containing the discovered rules and insights from the market basket analysis.

3. **Visualization**: Run the script `visualization.py` to generate visualizations based on the analyzed market basket data.

   python visualization.py
 
   The visualizations will be saved in the `output/` directory for further analysis.

Market basket analysis is a data mining technique used by retailers to discover purchasing patterns and relationships between products bought together by customers. It helps businesses understand customer behavior and make data-driven decisions for product placement, pricing, and promotions.

**Data Source:** 
reference:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aslanahmedov/market-basket-analysis
The data for market basket analysis can be sourced from various sources, including point-of-sale (POS) systems, online transactions, and customer loyalty programs. Retailers collect transactional data, such as customer IDs, product IDs, and purchase timestamps, to analyze shopping patterns.

**Brief Description:**
Market basket analysis aims to identify associations and correlations among products frequently purchased together. It uses algorithms like Apriori or FP-Growth to generate frequent itemsets and association rules. A frequent itemset is a set of items that frequently appear together in transactions, while association rules indicate the likelihood of one product being bought if another is purchased.

For example, a common finding might be that customers who buy bread are also likely to buy butter. The insights derived from market basket analysis help retailers optimize product placement, create targeted promotions, and enhance the overall customer experience. 

#Conclusion:
Market basket analysis provides valuable insights into customer purchasing patterns, allowing retailers to optimize product placement, tailor promotions, and enhance customer satisfaction based on the associations and correlations among products frequently bought together.
